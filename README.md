pomodoro
========

We don't want to brag, but XXX is probably the best existing Pomodoro time
tracker.

[Try it here](http://pomodoro.miximum.fr/).

Why is it the best?
-------------------

XXX is very cool for many reasons:

 * It's completly local, all data is stored in your own browser.
 * No need to create a useless account or sign in with a remote service.
 * Close the page, open it again: your timer keeps running.
 * Cool stats.
 * It's open-source!

Build your own
--------------

XXX is open-source and completely local, i.e it means you can build your own.
You will need git, npm and grunt installed.

 * git clone https://github.com/thibault/pomodoro.git
 * cd pomodoro
 * npm install
 * <your browser> src/index.html

Help, my stats disappeared when I changed browser / computer!
-------------------------------------------------------------

Your data is saved in localStorage, e.g in your browser.

Hugh, something is not working
------------------------------

We use modern web technologies, hence you muste use a modern web browser so
every feature can work flawlessly.

Who made this?
--------------

XXX was proudly created by [@namlook](http://elkorado.com/) and
[@thibaultj](http://miximum.fr/) during a two days coding session. Then it was
rewritten after the hangover.
